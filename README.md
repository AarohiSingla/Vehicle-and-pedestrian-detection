In the context of autonomous vehicles, accurate detection ensures that vehicles can navigate complex urban environments safely, recognizing and reacting to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles in real-time to prevent accidents.
This capability is fundamental for the vehicles to make informed decisions about speed, direction, and when to stop or yield, enhancing road safety for all users. 

In smart cities, vehicle and pedestrian detection contributes to the optimization of traffic flow and the management of public spaces. By analyzing movement patterns, smart city systems can adjust traffic signals to reduce congestion, improve pedestrian crossing times, and even allocate resources more efficiently, leading to safer, more sustainable, and user-friendly urban environments. 

Together, these technologies pave the way for a future where mobility is more integrated, predictive, and adaptive to the needs of society.
